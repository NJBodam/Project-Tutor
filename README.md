Project Description: Voice Interactive AI Tutor (ProjectTutor)
This is a Voice Interactive AI application designed to enhance student learning by providing dynamic, conversational support based on uploaded documents.

Core Functionality: The system ingests and processes source material (e.g., PDF textbooks, notes) and uses AI to generate real-time, context-aware answers and engage the user in a verbal Q&A format.

Current Focus (MVP): The application currently utilizes speech synthesis (Piper) and data indexing (FAISS) to allow students to interact vocally with PDF docs in German and translate to English. 

Key Technologies: Python, FAISS (for rapid semantic search/indexing), Piper (for high-quality speech synthesis), and a server-based architecture (server.py, ingest.py).
